    "## Activity Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will apply the Naïve Bayes theorem to a database that contains spam emails.\n",
    "Naïve Bayes is a classification technique based on Bayes theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    " - $P(A| B)$ is a conditional probability: the likelihood of event $A$ occurring given that $B$ is true.\n",
    " - $P(B|A)$ is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event $B$ occurring given that $A$ is true.\n",
    " - $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the probabilities of observing events $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a Naïve Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a *class* is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about three inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple. That is why it is known as ‘Naïve’.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity is designed to help you apply the machine learning algorithms that you have learned using *packages* in Python. Python concepts, instructions, and the starter code are embedded within this Jupyter Notebook to help guide you as you progress through the activity. Remember to run the code of each code cell prior to your submission. Upon completing the activity, you are encouraged to compare your work against the solution file to perform a self-assessment.\n"

Also, spam emails tend to have words written in all capital letters and use a lot of exclamation marks.\n",
